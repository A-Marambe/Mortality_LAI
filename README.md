# Tree Mortality and LAI - BIOL6500
This project uses classified polygons of the Aerial Detection Survey (ADS) to collect the Leaf Area Index from MODIS 8 LAI products for 23 years. It can cloud masking and compositing images into annual observations before analysis. It uses rasterstats package to collect descriptive statistics over 23 years for all ADS polygons to generate dataframes.

**Input**
Aerial Detection Survey Data  

**Outputs**  
Cleaned  Aerial Detection Survey data  
MODIS LAI data for any given polygon for any valid time frame (2000 to present)
Data management for LAI images, QC 
LAI , mortality data frame generation
Multinomial logistic regression Analysis
